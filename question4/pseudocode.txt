to get the super digit 
I will create a function that takes both the digit and concantanation number
I will multiply the digit input string by the concantanation numbber.
    I will then create a for loop that loops through the digits
        in the for loop I will add and total the value of the digits

    create a new if condition that checks if the values is larger than 9
        if so it returns the recursion of the function with the new total input and 1
    else:
        it will return the super digit




the time complexity of this will be o(n) * k which is just o(n) the k represents an inpuut with a reduced size that will be used
the storage will the constant o(1) as the single variables used for storage will not be growing in size
this is a linear approach
