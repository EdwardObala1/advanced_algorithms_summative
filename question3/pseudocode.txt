encryption
    create a storage size variable according to the number of keys
    initialise a counter
    loop through the list
        if the counter == key
            counter is set as zero and add charachter to the initial storage idex zero
        elif counter < key
            add the charachter to the index === counter
            add one to counter
        perform a join to the storage to return a joined encrypted text

decryption
    divide the encrypted text by the key value to get the length of each group
    initialise two pointer one alwasy at the first index of each group the other one at the last index of the next group
    initialise a for loop in the range of the length of each group
        in the for loop pick the charachter and then add the next corresponding one within each group 
        to decrypt the text 

        the time complexity of this is o(n) + o(n)
        the space complexity is o(1) as no additional and growing storage is used
