Initialization of all nodes with distance "infinite"; initialization of the starting node with 0
Marking of the distance of the starting node as permanent, all other distances as temporarily.
Setting of starting node as active.
Calculation of the temporary distances of all neighbour nodes of the active node by summing up its distance with the weights of the edges.
If such a calculated distance of a node is smaller as the current one, update the distance and set the current node as antecessor. This step is also called update and is Dijkstra's central idea.
Setting of the node with the minimal temporary distance as active. Mark its distance as permanent.
Repeating of steps 4 to 7 until there aren't any nodes left with a permanent distance, which neighbours still have temporary distances.
