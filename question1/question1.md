## Question 1

### Qn1
    To solve a mathematical problem that is required to return the sum of the first n numbers is our interest. There are a number of algorithms that can be used to solve the same problem. At this point we need to use loops to add the first n numbers and return the sum.

### Context

    n=8

    Numbers considered are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

    Sum will be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8

    The sum will be returned.

 
 
### Tasks to be completed
</br>

    Write the pseudo code for the algorithm (sufficiently commented)
    Derive the function of the running time of the algorithm and express the function in big-oh notation.
    Write the program and test it on four different values: 10, 10000, 1000000, 1000000000. What were your observations on the response time on every respective input? How did the output behave and why?
