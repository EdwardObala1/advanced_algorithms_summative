This is a linear problem where you have to go through all the elements in the object range and add one valuue with the next one
to solve this we will use a loop algotithm with the following time o(n) because we will be looping through 
each object in the range specified and space complexity of o(1)
as the only value we are changing is the tolal which we are going to be replacing the same variable over and over again

def get_total(value):
    a totals variable is initialised with zero
    also initialise a counter to keep track of the number count
    create a loop here either a while loop or for loop will do
    the break condition would be if the values are out of the range then the loop is broken
    it returns the total variable
