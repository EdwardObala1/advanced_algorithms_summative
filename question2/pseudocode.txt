giben a list of grades as array

the algorithsm loops through each value in the array and picks each value up
    I will then instantiate a new array of integers to hold the new grades
    within the loop I will have conditions to check if each value is less than 38 if so it stays the same
    if the number os not lett than 38
        another set of loops is created that get how many times does 5 divide the value without remainders
        I will then multiple 5 by the number of times and then add 5 on top this creates an upper value which checks
        The cpn dition then checks if the difference between the upper value and the grade is less than 3 
            if it is it rounds it up
        else
            it appends the value as is into the new list of grades

The time complexity of this problem is o(n) as using one loop you go through the list once
the space complexity is o(n) as well as the space taken will grow with the value input
